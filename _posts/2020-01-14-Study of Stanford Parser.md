## Introduction

Stanford CoreNLP offers a collection of computational resources for the processing of natural language. Many NLP tools can be found in Stanford CoreNLP, 
such as the part-of-speech(POS) tagger, Stanford parser and sentiment analysis. This survey will focus on the Stanford parser which can accomplish different multilingual parsing tasks. 
To understand how Stanford parsers can support multilingual parsing with good performance, papers about the Universal Dependencies (UD) framework,  Neural Networks based parser and Compositional Vector Grammar parser will be studied. 


## Universal Dependencies

>Key Wordï¼šuniversal Dependency


Multilingual syntax and parsing work have long been impeded by the fact that annotation schemes differ widely across languages. The Universal Dependencies (UD) project aims to address this problem by creating cross-linguistically compatible treebank annotations for many languages.
